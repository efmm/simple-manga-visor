==================

A comic and manga viewer multiplatform made with kivy 1.7 and python 2.7

#Description

Here is a simple app made with kivy 1.7 about one year ago.
The app is a image viewer created for viewing manga or comic.
It works on Linux (with python and kivy), MAC, Windows (with python and kivy or may be compiled), Android (compiled with python for android).

#Run

* First install kivy, in linux with pip (install python and pip before):
 sudo pip install kivy

* then go to the folder and run
python main.py

#Tested

* It's tested on windows.
* The last version should work on linux, but right now I have a fucking problem making work properly kivy on debian.

#Acknowledgements

*Thanks to the documentation of kivy.
*And the snippets that I copied from the forums and google.

#All
And that's all. You can fork this project or use snippets from this app, it's licensed in MIT license, see the LICENCE file.
